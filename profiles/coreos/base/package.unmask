# Overwrite portage-stable mask - this package was removed in

# Overwrite portage-stable mask. We are delaying the transition to
# libxcrypt, because we need to figure out how to solve the dep loop
# that results from the migration (python -> virtual/libcrypt ->
# libxcrypt -> glibc -> python), and also we need to update gcc to
# version 10 or later.
